This repository hosts a complete workshop on Spring Boot + Spring WebFlux.
Just follow this README and create your first WebFlux applications!
Each step of this workshop has its companion commit in the git history with a detailed commit message.

We'll create two applications:

* `stock-quotes` is a functional WebFlux app which streams stock quotes
* `trading-service` is an annotation-based WebFlux app using a datastore, HTML views, and several browser-related technologies

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

. Computer with enough CPU and RAM to run your IDE
. JDK 1.8+ (example source uses 1.8)
. Your favorite IDE
. Ability to download Java libraries (no blocking security policies)
. Admin privileges to install optional software
. https://run.pivotal.io[Free Pivotal Web Services account]

=== Reference Docs

* http://projectreactor.io/docs[Reactor Core documentation]
* Spring WebFlux 
{spring-framework-doc-base}/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#spring-webflux[reference documentation]
and {spring-framework-doc-base}/javadoc-api/[javadoc]

=== Extra Help (optional)

The Spring WebFlux Workshop comes complete with source code, so you can work your way through with working examples. We don’t want to assume your experience level, so here are some helpful resources if tackling the Spring WebFlux Workshop seems just a bit too advanced.

=== Lombok Setup

In this workshop, you will simplify Java class definitions (constructors, getters, setters) by using annotations provided by Lombok. Your IDE may not necessarily recognize the generated code, but the app should still compile.

If your IDE does not recognize the generated code and you want it to, download Lombok https://projectlombok.org/download[here] and run the downloaded jar `java -jar ~/Downloads/lombok.jar`. This may detect your IDE. If it doesn't, locate the `.exe` or `.ini` for your IDE. After completing the patch, restarting your IDE will now include the Lombok integration.

== Stock Quotes application

=== Create the application

Go to `https://start.spring.io` and create a Maven project with Spring Boot {spring-boot-version}. 
For Group use `io.spring.workshop` and for Artifact use `stock-quotes`.

Under Dependencies search for and add the following to your project:

* Spring Reactive Web
* Lombok

Click 'Generate the project' to download it, then unzip and import the Maven project into your favorite IDE.

If generated correctly, you should have a main `Application` class that looks like this:

[source,java]
.stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/StockQuotesApplication.java
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/StockQuotesApplication.java[]
----

Edit your `application.properties` file to start the server on a specific port.

[source,properties]
.stock-quotes/src/main/resources/application.properties
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

Launching it from your IDE or with `mvn spring-boot:run` should start a Netty server on port 8081.
You should see in the logs something like:

[source,bash]
----
INFO 2208 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.web.embedded.netty.NettyWebServer  : Netty started on port(s): 8081
INFO 2208 --- [  restartedMain] i.s.w.s.StockQuotesApplication           : Started StockQuotesApplication in 1.905 seconds (JVM running for 3.075)
----

=== Create a Quote Generator

To simulate real stock values, we'll create a generator that emits such values at a specific interval.
Copy the following classes to your project.

[source,java]
.stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/Quote.java
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/Quote.java[]
----

[source,java]
.stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/QuoteGenerator.java
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/QuoteGenerator.java[]
----


=== Functional web applications with "WebFlux.fn"

Spring WebFlux comes in two flavors of web applications: annotation based and functional.
For this first application, we'll use the functional variant.

Incoming HTTP requests are handled by a `HandlerFunction`, which is essentially a function
that takes a ServerRequest and returns a `Mono<ServerResponse>`. The annotation counterpart
to a handler function would be a Controller method.

But how are those incoming requests routed to the right handler?

We're using a `RouterFunction`, which is a function that takes a `ServerRequest`, and returns
a `Mono<HandlerFunction>`. If a request matches a particular route, a handler function is returned;
otherwise it returns an empty `Mono`. The `RouterFunction` has a similar purpose as the `@RequestMapping`
annotation in `@Controller` classes.

Take a look at the code samples in 
{spring-framework-doc-base}/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-fn[the Spring WebFlux.fn reference documentation]

=== Create your first HandlerFunction + RouterFunction

First, create a `QuoteHandler` class and mark is as a `@Component`; this class will have all our handler functions as methods.

Now create a `hello` handler function in that class that always returns "text/plain" HTTP responses with "Hello Spring!" as body.

To route requests to that handler, you need to expose a `RouterFunction` to Spring Boot.
Create a `QuoteRouter` configuration class (i.e. annotated with `@Configuration`) 
that creates a bean of type `RouterFunction<ServerResponse>`.

Modify that class so that GET requests to `"/hello"` are routed to the handler you just implemented.

TIP: Since `QuoteHandler` is a component, you can inject it in `@Bean` methods as a method parameter.

Your application should now behave like this:
[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8081/hello -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
transfer-encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8

Hello Spring!%
----

Once done, add another endpoint:

* with a HandlerFunction `echo` that echoes the request body in the response, as "text/plain"
* and an additional route in our existing `RouterFunction` that accepts POST requests on
`"/echo"` with a "text/plain" body and returns responses with the same content type.

You can also use this new endpoint with:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8081/echo -i -d "WebFlux workshop" -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
transfer-encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain

WebFlux workshop%
----


=== Expose the Flux<Quotes> as an API

First, let's declare a `Flux<Quote>` class field will emits a `Quote` every 1000 msec and can be **shared** between multiple subscribers (look at the `Flux` operators for that). Next, inject `QuoteGenerator` in the constructor of `QuoteHandler`.

Now create a `streamQuotes` method that streams generated quotes with the `"application/stream+json"` content type. Add the corresponding part in the `RouterFunction`, on the `"/quotes"` endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8081/quotes -i -H "Accept: application/stream+json"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
transfer-encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/stream+json

{"ticker":"CTXS","price":84.0,"instant":1494841666.633000000}
{"ticker":"DELL","price":67.1,"instant":1494841666.834000000}
{"ticker":"GOOG","price":869,"instant":1494841667.034000000}
{"ticker":"MSFT","price":66.5,"instant":1494841667.231000000}
{"ticker":"ORCL","price":46.13,"instant":1494841667.433000000}
{"ticker":"RHT","price":86.9,"instant":1494841667.634000000}
{"ticker":"VMW","price":93.7,"instant":1494841667.833000000}
----


Let's now create a variant. Instead of streaming all values (with an infinite stream), we can
now take the last "n" elements of that `Flux` and return them as a collection of Quotes with
the content type `"application/json"`. Note that you should take the requested number of Quotes
from the request itself, with the query parameter named `"size"` (or pick `10` as the default size
if none was provided).

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/quotes -i -H "Accept: application/json"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
transfer-encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/json

[{"ticker":"CTXS","price":85.8,"instant":1494842241.716000000},{"ticker":"DELL","price":64.69,"instant":1494842241.913000000},{"ticker":"GOOG","price":856.5,"instant":1494842242.112000000},{"ticker":"MSFT","price":68.2,"instant":1494842242.317000000},{"ticker":"ORCL","price":47.4,"instant":1494842242.513000000},{"ticker":"RHT","price":85.6,"instant":1494842242.716000000},{"ticker":"VMW","price":96.1,"instant":1494842242.914000000},{"ticker":"CTXS","price":85.5,"instant":1494842243.116000000},{"ticker":"DELL","price":64.88,"instant":1494842243.316000000},{"ticker":"GOOG","price":889,"instant":1494842243.517000000}]%
----


=== Integration tests with WebTestClient

Spring WebFlux (actually the `spring-test` module) includes a `WebTestClient`
that can be used to test WebFlux server endpoints with or without a running server.
Tests without a running server are comparable to MockMvc from Spring MVC where mock requests 
and responses are used instead of connecting over the network using a socket.
The WebTestClient however can also perform tests against a running server.

You can check that your last endpoint is working properly with the following
integration test:

[source,java]
.stock-quotes/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/StockQuotesApplicationTests.java
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/StockQuotesApplicationTests.java[]
----

=== Deploy to Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry is an open source, multi cloud application Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). We will easily deploy our apps on Cloud Foundry on Amazon Web Service infrastructure. The same process may be used for Azure, Google Compute Platform, vSphere, and other Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers where Cloud Foundry is used. 

. Create a free account at https://run.pivotal.io
. Login to Pivotal Web Services
. Download the CLI by navigating to Tools at https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools

Login with your account credentials
[source,bash]
----
$ cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io
----

Create an application manifest which provides metadata to Cloud Foundry telling it how to deploy your application. Make sure you make the route a unique value. This is the URL used to access your app.
[source,bash]
.stock-quotes/manifest.yml
----
include::../stock-quotes/manifest.yml[]
----

Deploy your application from the root directory where the manifest.yml file is located.
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push
----

Make sure your application starts. You should see something similar to this.
[source,bash]
----

== Trading Service application

=== Create the application

Go to `https://start.spring.io` and create a Maven project with Spring Boot {spring-boot-version}. 
For Group use `io.spring.workshop` and for Artifact use `trading-service`.

Under Dependencies search for and add the following to your project:

* Spring Reactive Web
* Spring Boot DevTools
* Thymeleaf
* Spring Data Reactive MongoDB
* Lombok

Unzip the given file into a directory and import into your favorite IDE.

=== Use Tomcat as a web engine

By default, `spring-boot-starter-webflux` transitively brings `spring-boot-starter-reactor-netty`
and Spring Boot auto-configures Reactor Netty as a web server. For this application, we'll use
Tomcat as an alternative.

[source,xml]
.trading-service/pom.xml
----
include::../trading-service/pom.xml[tags=tomcat]
----

Note that Spring Boot supports Undertow and Jetty in addition to Netty and Tomcat.

=== Use a reactive datastore

In this application we'll use a MongoDB datastore with its reactive driver;
for this workshop we'll use an in-memory instance of MongoDB. Add the following:

[source,xml]
.trading-service/pom.xml
----
include::../trading-service/pom.xml[tags=inMemMongo]
----

We'd like to manage `TradingUser` with our datastore.

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/TradingUser.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/TradingUser.java[]
----

Create a `TradingUserRepository` interface that extends `ReactiveMongoRepository`.
Add a `findByUserName(String userName)` method that returns a single `TradingUser` in a reactive fashion.

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/TradingUserRepository.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/TradingUserRepository.java[]
----

=== Create add users utility

We'd like to insert users in our datastore when the application starts up. For that, create a `UsersCommandLineRunner`
component that implements Spring Boot's `CommandLineRunner`. In the `run` method, use the reactive repository
to insert `TradingUser` instances in the datastore.

NOTE: Since the `run` method returns void, it expects a blocking implementation. This is why you should use the
`blockLast(Duration)` operator on the `Flux` returned by the repository when inserting data.
You can also `then().block(Duration)` to turn that `Flux` into a `Mono<Void>` that waits for completion.

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/UsersCommandLineRunner.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/UsersCommandLineRunner.java[]
----


=== Create a REST service

We're now going to expose `TradingUser` through a Controller.
First, create a `UserController` annotated with `@RestController`.
Then add two new Controller methods in order to handle:

* GET requests to  `"/users"`, returning all `TradingUser` instances, serializing them with content-type `"application/json"`
* GET requests to  `"/users/{username}"`, returning a single `TradingUser` instance, serializing it with content-type `"application/json"`

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/UserController.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/UserController.java[]
----

=== Create a unit test

You can now validate your implementation with the following test (which you wrote before you wrote the controller, right?):

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/UserControllerTests.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/UserControllerTests.java[]
----

=== Use Thymeleaf to render HTML views

We already added the Thymeleaf Boot starter when we created our trading application.

First, let's add a couple of WebJar dependencies to get static resources for our application:

[source,xml]
.trading-service/pom.xml
----
include::../trading-service/pom.xml[tags=webjars]
----

We can now create HTML templates in our `src/main/resources/templates` folder and map them using controllers.

[source,html]
.trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/index.html
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/index.html[]
----

As you can see in that template, we loop over the `"users"` attribute and write a row in our HTML table for each.

Let's display those users in our application:

* Create a `HomeController` Controller
* Add a Controller method that handles GET requests to `"/"`
* Inject the Spring `Model` on that method and add a `"users"` attribute to it

NOTE: Spring WebFlux will automatically resolve `Publisher` instances before rendering the view,
there's no need to involve blocking code at all!

=== Use the WebClient to stream JSON to the browser

In this section, we'll call our remote `stock-quotes` service to get Quotes from it, so we first need to:

* copy over the `Quote` class to this application
* add the following template file to your application:

[source,html]
.trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/quotes.html
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/quotes.html[]
----

As you can see in this template file, loading the quotes.html page will cause the browser to send a request to 
the server for `Quotes` using the Server Sent Event (SSE) transport.

Now create a `QuotesController` annotated with `@Controller` and add two new methods.
One that renders the `quotes.html` template for incoming `"GET /quotes"` requests.
The other should respond to `"GET /quotes/feed"` requests with the `"text/event-stream"` content-type,
with a `Flux<Quote>` as the response body. This data is already served by the `stock-quotes` application
, so you can use a `WebClient` to request the remote service to retrieve that `Flux`.

TIP: You should avoid making a request to the `stock-quotes` service for every browser connecting to that page; 
for that, you can use the `Flux.share()` operator.

=== Create and Configure a WebSocketHandler

WebFlux includes functional reactive WebSocket client and server support.

On the server side there are two main components: `WebSocketHandlerAdapter` will handle the incoming
requests by delegating to the configured `WebSocketService` and `WebSocketHandler` will be responsible
for handling the WebSocket session.

Take a look at the code samples in 
{spring-framework-doc-base}/spring-framework-reference/web.html#web-reactive-websocket-support[Reactive WebSocket Support documentation]

First, create an `EchoWebSocketHandler` class; it has to implement `WebSocketHandler`.
Now implement `handle(WebSocketSession session)` method. The handler echoes the incoming messages with a delay of 1s.

To route requests to that handler, you need to map the above WebSocket handler to a specific URL: here, `"/websocket/echo"`.

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/websocket/EchoWebSocketHandler.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/websocket/EchoWebSocketHandler.java[]
----


Create a `WebSocketRouter` configuration class (i.e. annotated with `@Configuration`) that creates a bean of type `HandlerMapping`.
Create one additional bean of type `WebSocketHandlerAdapter` which will delegate the processing of
the incoming request to the default `WebSocketService` which is `HandshakeWebSocketService`.

Now create a `WebSocketController` annotated with @Controller and add a method that renders the
`websocket.html` template for incoming `"GET /websocket"` requests.

Add the following template file to your application:

[source,html]
.trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/websocket.html
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/websocket.html[]
----

Make sure you update the URL to the WebSocket address in the template.

[source,html]
----
var socket = new WebSocket("wss://trading-service-<your initials here>.cfapps.io:4443/websocket/echo");
----

=== Integration tests with WebSocketClient

`WebSocketClient` included in Spring WebFlux can be used to test your WebSocket endpoints.

You can check that your WebSocket endpoint, created in the previous section, is working properly with the 
following integration test:

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/websocket/EchoWebSocketHandlerTests.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/websocket/EchoWebSocketHandlerTests.java[]
----

=== Deploy to Cloud Foundry

Login with your account credentials
[source,bash]
----
$ cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io
----

Update the application manifest which provides metadata to Cloud Foundry telling it how to deploy your application. Make sure you update the route to a unique value. This is the URL used to access your app.
[source,bash]
.trading-service/manifest.yml
----
include::../trading-service/manifest.yml[]
----

Deploy your application
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push
----

Make sure your application starts. You should see something similar to this.
[source,bash]
----
     state     since                  cpu    memory         disk           details
